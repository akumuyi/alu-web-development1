    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am Abiodun Kumuyi, the founder of Trade Monastery®, a financial service powerhouse. I started my journey into the world of finance and technical analysis in the global forex market just before the COVID-19 pandemic began😷. In addition to my passion for technology and finance, I'm an avid long-distance runner🏃, which helps me stay fit without the need for a gym membership😂😉. My favorite sport is football ⚽(or soccer, as my American friends would call it), once I had dreamed I won the Ballon D'or🥇😂. Before joining the African Leadership University (ALU) in January 2023, I pursued my prior education in Nigeria, where I trained as a mechanical engineer. My goal is to leverage the skills and knowledge I acquire over the next five years to develop innovative, inclusive, and impactful solutions to address the persistent issue of poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
