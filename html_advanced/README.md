# Project Title: Webpage Structure - HTML Only

In this project, I have implemented the HTML structure for a webpage based on the provided designer file. This project focuses solely on the HTML markup, without any CSS or styling. Each section of the webpage has been organized and structured using semantic HTML elements to ensure clarity, accessibility, and maintainability.

## Features

### 1. Headers

The Headers section contains the top portion of the webpage, featuring the page logo and navigation buttons.

- The logo is represented using an `<img>` tag with appropriate alt text for accessibility.
- Navigation buttons for "Courses," "Pricing," and "Login" are structured using `<nav>` and `<ul>` elements.

### 2. Main Part

The Main Part is the central content area of the webpage, where the primary information and sections are presented. It includes:

- Headings and paragraphs to introduce the main content.
- Structured sections for testimonials, tutorials, free membership, FAQ, and the footer.

### 3. Part 1 - Testimonials

The Testimonials section showcases customer reviews and feedback. Each testimonial is represented as a separate block within the section, providing clear separation and readability.

- Testimonial content is enclosed within a `<blockquote>` element, with appropriate attribution using `<cite>`.
- The section is appropriately labeled with a heading.

### 4. Part 2 - Tutorials

The Tutorials section presents information about available tutorials. Each tutorial is presented in a structured manner for easy comprehension.

- Tutorials are organized using lists or other suitable HTML elements, ensuring proper indentation and hierarchy.
- Descriptive headings provide context for each tutorial category.

### 5. Part 3 - Free Membership

The Free Membership section highlights the benefits of signing up for a free membership.

- Clear headings and concise paragraphs outline the advantages.
- A visually engaging layout is achieved through the use of appropriate HTML elements.

### 6. Part 4 - FAQ

The FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) section provides answers to common queries users might have.

- Questions and answers are presented in a structured format, making it easy for users to find the information they need.
- Each question is enclosed within an `<h3>` element, and answers are included in suitable containers.

### 7. Part 5 - Footer

The Footer section contains information typically found at the bottom of a webpage, such as contact details and links to social media.

- The footer is organized using lists and paragraphs.
- Contact information is included, along with links to relevant social media profiles.

## Conclusion

This project establishes the fundamental structure of a webpage using semantic HTML elements. The use of semantic HTML ensures that the content is well-organized, accessible, and ready for styling and additional functionality in future projects.
