# Project Title: Webpage Structure - HTML Only

In this project, I have implemented the HTML structure for a webpage based on the provided designer file. This project focuses solely on the HTML markup, without any CSS or styling. Each section of the webpage has been organized and structured using semantic HTML elements to ensure clarity, accessibility, and maintainability.
